		<h1> Version 0.1 download </h1>
		<p> 
		We're thrilled to announce that the playable alpha demo for Queenslayer is now LIVE! 
		Included is an alpha version of our first character, Nora, who can be played in both versus and training mode. 
		It is not the latest version of the game, as it does not include the second playable character, the archer Deirdre.
		We plan to update the alpha over time to include new features such as Netplay, new characters, new stages and mechanics. 
		We are still early in development, so your feedback is invaluable in shaping the future of our game. 
		<br> <br>
		<a href = "https://hithubgames.itch.io/queenslayer" target="blank"> Download now and let us know what you think! </a>
		<br> <br>
		<p> 
		Alternatively, try the <a href = "https://hithubgames.itch.io/queenslayer-training-only" target="blank"> browser-based</a> version that does not require downloading the game files to play!
		This version includes full controller support but is limited to training mode only (as of now).
		This version will be updated parallel to the executable version.

		<p> Controls can be changed in game to suit the player's preferences. </p>
		<p style="color: #ffffff"> Before you complain about how weird the keyboard controls are, they were necessary for two player testing. </p>
		
		<h2> Commands </h2>
		<h3> Normal Attacks (A/B/C) </h3>
		<p> 
		Basic attacks that are performed with the attacking buttons.
		Knowing their variable speeds, ranges and applications is the key to victory.
		They can be strung together for high damaging combos.
		</p>
		<h3> Comand Normals (direction + A/B/C) </h3>		
		<p> 
		A normal attack that requires the player to input an attack button in conjunction with a direction. 
		Some are shared by all characters, such as anti-air (→ + A) and overhead (→ + C).
		Others are unique to the character, such as Nora's standing low attack "Toe Stepper" (→ + B).
		</p>
		<h3> Special Moves (direction + D) </h3>
		<p>
		Strong attacks that enhance a character's versatility, damage output, survivability, or all at once.
		They are performed by pressing the special attack button with a directional input.
		While strong, they typically require mana to execute deplete the player's mana reserves.
		</p>
		<h3> Super Moves (A/B/C + D) </h3>
		<p> 
		Extremely powerful attacks that consume 50% of a super bar.
		Performed by pressing an attack button (A/B/C)
		It's best to keep track of both meters in order to not get surprised by one and take massive damage.
		</p>
		<h3> Dash </h3>
		<p> 
		An easy way to quickly gain horizontal distance, on ground or in the air.
		They are useful for screen traversal, aggressively approaches, capitalizing on an opponent's mistakes and even combo extensions.
		Depending on the character's abilities, their ground dash may be replaced by a run, increasing their horizontal moving speed.
		Be careful not to use them too much, as they deplete the player's stamina meter, increasing the chances of a Guard Break.
		</p>
		<h3> Roll </h3>
		<p> 
		Some characters can execute a roll by pressing the dash button while crouching, allowing them to evade high attacks and pass through the enemy.		
		</p>
		<h3> Blocking </h3>
		<p> 
		Enemy attacks can be guarded against by holding the movement button that is opposite to them.
		High/low attacks additionally require the defender to choose between blocking while standing and crouching.
		Blocking depletes the player's stamina by an insignificant amount, but should they let it deplete completely they will suffer a Guard Break.
		</p>
		<h3> Throw (direction + A + B) </h3>
		<p> 
		To counter enemies who overly rely on blocking, you can grab them using the attack buttons (A) and (B).
		Other player has a short window of time to input their own grab and nullify the attack.
		Depending on the direction being held by the initiator, they might perform a forward or back throw.
		</p>
		<h3> Parry </h3>
		<p> 
		Allows players to enter a parrying stance when pressing the Parry button, initiating a parry if they are attacked in the state.
		</p>
		<h3> Burst (Dash + A) </h3>
		<p> 
		A defensive mechanic that allows players to escape combos as long as their designated Burst meter is filled.
		Once it has been used, the meter will fill up again over the course of the round.
		</p>
		<h3> Use Items (Parry + A/B/C/D) </h3>
		<p> 
		If the player has collected any perishable items between rounds (signified in blue), they can use them by pressing the parry button and an attack button.
		The attack button needed to be pressed depends on which slot the item is in, with items in the first slot being used with Parry + (A), second with Parry + (B), etc.
		</p>
		
		<h1> Game Elements </h1>
		<h3> Timer </h3>
		<p>
		From the beginning of a round, it counts down until it reaches zero, awarding the player with the higher amount of health by then with the victory.
		</p>
		<h3> Health Bar </h3>
		<p>
		A visual representation of the player's remaining health. As it drains, the player becomes closer to defeat.
		</p>	
		<h3> Mana Bar </h3>
		<p>
		A visual representation of the player's remaining mana, the resource that allows players to utilize special moves.
		</p>	
		<h3> Stamina Bar </h3>
		<p>
		A visual representation of the player's remaining stamina, the resource that allows players to use movement techniques and block incoming attacks.
		</p>		
		<h3> Super Bar </h3>
		<p>
		A visual representation of the player's remaining super meter, the resource that allows players to use dangerous super moves.
		Half a bar is required to use them.
		</p>	
		<h3> Items </h3>
		<p>
		Should the players choose to enable them, items can be collected between rounds that provide a spectrum of benefits.
		Passive items provide benefits automatically throughout the game, slightly increasing their potential.
		Perishable items are used by the player to gain immediate, severe buffs that can turn the tide of battle.
		</p>
		<h3> Item Display </h3>
		<p>
		A series of panels that displays what items the player has collected between rounds, should they choose to enable them.
		Passive items are represented in yellow while perishable items are represented in blue.
		</p>		
		<h3> Parrying </h3>
		<p> 
		By entering the parry state before being hit by the attack, the player will take no damage and recover in a short amount of time.
		If timed extremely precisely, they will initiate a Perfect Parry and recover in an even shorter amount of time.
		</p>
		<h3> Guard Break </h3>
		<p>
		When a player blocks an attack with no stamina remaining, they will be stunned for a short while.
		To prevent this, players must be wise with how they manage their stamina.
		</p>
		
		<h1> Modes </h1>
		<p> For the current build of the game, only Versus and Training modes are enabled. Planned modes in the future include an Arcade mode and single-player adventure mode.</p>
		<h3> Versus </h3>
		<p> Fight against another player locally in one-on-one battles. 
		Currently, the only character that can be selected is Nora.
		If enabled, players will be able to select items to use in the next round. </p>
		<h3> Training </h3>
		<p> Practice your combos and movement abilities against a stationary opponent with regenerating health.</p>
