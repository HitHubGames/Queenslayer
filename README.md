# Queenslayer
We're thrilled to announce that the playable alpha demo for Queenslayer is now LIVE!  Included is an alpha version of our first character, Nora, who can be played in both versus and training mode. We plan to update the alpha over time to include new features such as Netplay, new characters, new stages and mechanics. We are still early in development, so your feedback is invaluable in shaping the future of our game.
